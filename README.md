# A Bootstrap 4 Portfolio Template

## Overview

This project is based on an assignment to build a portfolio layout using the Bootstrap 4 CSS Framework. This would be for a portfolio to market your skills as a frontend developer prior to learning javascript and JS frameworks such as React.

I also adapted Bootstrap 4 HTML/CSS to tailor the template.

Responsive design works with most devices and browsers
