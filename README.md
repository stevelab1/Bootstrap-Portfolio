# A Bootstrap 4 Portfolio Template

## Overview

This project is based on an assignment to build a portfolio layout using the Bootstrap 4 CSS Framework. This would be for a portfolio to market your skills as a frontend developer prior to learning javascript and JS frameworks such as React.

We will also adapt Bootstrap 4 HTML/CSS to tailor the template.

## Instructions

4. Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

   The website should include the following bootstrap components:

   - A Navigation bar

   - A navigation menu at the top. Feel free to use bootstrap's navbar or create your own.

     - Include links that are applicable to your portfolio.

       - Links should navigate to the appropriate sections

   - A hero section

     - A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.

   - A work section

     - A section displaying your work in grid.

       - If you need to use placeholder image use: https://placehold.co/

     - Use bootstrap cards for each project.

       - The description should give a brief overview of the work.

     - Each project will eventually link to your class project work!

   - A skills section

     - List out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp.

   - An about / contact section.

     - An "About Me" section in the same row.

   - Footer section.

     - All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.

     - All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.
