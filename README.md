# A Bootstrap 4 Portfolio Template

## Overview

This project is based on an assignment to build a portfolio layout using the Bootstrap 4 CSS Framework. This would be for a portfolio to market your skills as a frontend developer prior to learning javascript and JS frameworks such as React.

We will also adapt Bootstrap 4 HTML/CSS to tailor the template.

## Question

Would you use Bootstrap or CSS Grid, or opt for a build that uses more JS or perhaps a JS framework for the portfolio, or would you like to keep it simple and link to more complex or advanced projects?

## Instructions



       - Place all your images in this folder.

4. Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

   The website should include the following bootstrap components:

    - A Navigation bar
    
    - A navigation menu at the top. Feel free to use bootstrap's navbar or create your own.

      - Include links that are applicable to your portfolio.
  
        - Links should navigate to the appropriate sections 

    - A hero section

        - A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.

    - A work section

      - A section displaying your work in grid. 

        - If you need to use placeholder image use: https://placehold.co/ 

      - Use bootstrap cards for each project.

        - The description should give a brief overview of the work.

      - Each project will eventually link to your class project work!

    - A skills section

      - List out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp.

    - An about / contact section.

      - An "About Me" section in the same row.
    
    - A footer section.

      - All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.

      - All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.

5. Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.

6. Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.
